AutoGPT is a pure rust framework that simplifies AI agent creation and management for various tasks. Its remarkable speed and versatility are complemented by a mesh of built-in interconnected GPTs, ensuring exceptional performance and adaptability.

## üß† Framework Overview

### ‚öôÔ∏è Agent Core Architecture

AutoGPT agents are modular and autonomous, built from composable components:

- üîå **Tools & Sensors**: Interface with the real world via actions (e.g., file I/O, APIs) and perception (e.g., audio, video, data).
- üß† **Memory & Knowledge**: Combines long-term vector memory with structured knowledge bases for reasoning and recall.
- üß≠ **Planner & Goals**: Breaks down complex tasks into subgoals and tracks progress dynamically.
- üßç **Persona & Capabilities**: Customizable behavior profiles and access controls define how agents act.
- üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë **Collaboration**: Agents can delegate, swarm, or work in teams with other agents.
- ü™û **Self-Reflection**: Introspection module to debug, adapt, or evolve internal strategies.
- üîÑ **Context Management**: Manages active memory (context window) for ongoing tasks and conversations.
- üìÖ **Scheduler**: Time-based or reactive triggers for agent actions.

### üöÄ Developer Features

AutoGPT is designed for flexibility, integration, and scalability:

- üß™ **Custom Agent Creation**: Build tailored agents for different roles or domains.
- üìã **Task Orchestration**: Manage and distribute tasks across agents efficiently.
- üß± **Extensibility**: Add new tools, behaviors, or agent types with ease.
- üíª **CLI Tools**: Command-line interface for rapid experimentation and control.
- üß∞ **SDK Support**: Embed AutoGPT into existing projects or systems seamlessly.

## üì¶ Installation

Please refer to [our tutorial](INSTALLATION.md) for guidance on installing, running, and/or building the CLI from source using either Cargo or Docker.

> [!NOTE]
> For optimal performance and compatibility, we strongly advise utilizing a Linux operating system to install this CLI.

## üîÑ Workflow

AutoGPT supports two modes of operation, enabling both standalone and distributed use cases:

### 1. üß† Agentic Networkless Mode (Standalone)

<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d47b1d8-b2f2-4d23-a1f4-da926e425330"></video>

In this mode, the user runs an individual `autogpt` agent directly via a subcommand (e.g., `autogpt arch`). Each agent operates independently without needing a networked orchestrator.

```

- ‚úçÔ∏è **User Input**: Provide a project's goal (e.g. "Develop a full stack app that fetches today's weather. Use the axum web framework for the backend and the Yew rust framework for the frontend.").
- üöÄ **Initialization**: AutoGPT initializes based on the user's input, creating essential components such as the `ManagerGPT` and individual agent instances (ArchitectGPT, BackendGPT, FrontendGPT).
- üõ†Ô∏è **Agent Configuration**: Each agent is configured with its unique objectives and capabilities, aligning them with the project's defined goals. This configuration ensures that agents contribute effectively to the project's objectives.
- üìã **Task Allocation**: ManagerGPT distributes tasks among agents considering their capabilities and project requirements.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Task Execution**: Agents execute tasks asynchronously, leveraging their specialized functionalities.
- üîÑ **Feedback Loop**: Continuous feedback updates users on project progress and addresses issues.

### 2. üåê Agentic Networking Mode (Orchestrated)

<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecd82549-a48f-49c2-b751-23f74820bf3d"></video>

In networking mode, `autogpt` connects to an external orchestrator (`orchgpt`) over a secure TLS-encrypted TCP channel. This orchestrator manages agent lifecycles, routes commands, and enables rich inter-agent collaboration using a unified protocol.

AutoGPT introduces a novel and scalable communication protocol called [`IAC`](IAC.md) (Inter/Intra-Agent Communication), enabling seamless and secure interactions between agents and orchestrators, inspired by [operating system IPC mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication).

In networking mode, AutoGPT utilizes a layered architecture:

```sh
                       +------------------------------------+
                       |                User                |
                       |         Sends Prompt via CLI       |
                       +------------------+-----------------+
                                          |
                                          v
                            TLS + Protobuf over TCP to:
                       +------------------+-----------------+
                       |             Orchestrator           |
                       |     Receives and Routes Commands   |
                       +-----------+----------+-------------+
                                   |          |
     +-----------------------------+          +----------------------------+
     |                                                                     |
     v                                                                     v
+--------------------+                                         +--------------------+
|   ArchitectGPT     |<---------------- IAC ------------------>|    ManagerGPT      |

   |                        Agent Layer:                                   |
   |          (BackendGPT, FrontendGPT, DesignerGPT)                       |
   +-------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
                                         |
                                         v
                               Task Execution & Collection
                                         |
                                         v
                           +---------------------------+
                           |           User            |
                           |     Receives Final Output |
                           +---------------------------+
```

All communication happens securely over **TLS + TCP**, with messages encoded in **Protocol Buffers (protobuf)** for efficiency and structure.

1. User Input: The user provides a project prompt like:

   ```sh
   /architect create "fastapi app" | python
   ```

   This is securely sent to the Orchestrator over TLS.

1. Initialization: The Orchestrator parses the command and initializes the appropriate agent (e.g., `ArchitectGPT`).

1. Agent Configuration: Each agent is instantiated with its specialized goals:

   - **ArchitectGPT**: Plans system structure
   - **BackendGPT**: Generates backend logic
   - **FrontendGPT**: Builds frontend UI
   - **DesignerGPT**: Handles design

1. Task Allocation: `ManagerGPT` dynamically assigns subtasks to agents using the IAC protocol. It determines which agent should perform what based on capabilities and the original user goal.

1. Task Execution: Agents execute their tasks, communicate with their subprocesses or other agents via IAC (inter/intra communication), and push updates or results back to the orchestrator.

1. Feedback Loop: Throughout execution, agents return status reports. The `ManagerGPT` collects all output, and the Orchestrator sends it back to the user.
