- ‚úçÔ∏è **User Input**: Provide a project's goal (e.g. "Develop a full stack app that fetches today's weather. Use the axum web framework for the backend and the Yew rust framework for the frontend.").
  
- üöÄ **Initialization**: AutoGPT initializes based on the user's input, creating essential components such as the ManagerGPT and individual agent instances (ArchitectGPT, BackendGPT, FrontendGPT).
  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Agent Configuration**: Each agent is configured with its unique objectives and capabilities, aligning them with the project's defined goals. This configuration ensures that agents contribute effectively to the project's objectives.
  
- üìã **Task Allocation**: ManagerGPT distributes tasks among agents considering their capabilities and project requirements.
  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Task Execution**: Agents execute tasks asynchronously, leveraging their specialized functionalities.
  
- üîÑ **Feedback Loop**: Continuous feedback updates users on project progress and addresses issues.
  
## ü§ñ Available Agents

At the current release, Autogpt consists of 8 built-in specialized autonomous AI agents ready to assist you in bringing your ideas to life!
Refer to [our guide](AGENTS.md) to learn more about how the built-in agents work.
