## üì¶ Installation

You can install AutoGPT cli using the following command:

```bash
cargo install autogpt --features=cli
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è CLI Usage

The CLI provides a convenient means to interact with the code generation ecosystem. Before utilizing the CLI and or the SDK, your need to set up the necessary environment variables.

### Environment Variables Setup

To configure the CLI and or the SDK environment, follow these steps:

1. **Define Workspace Path**: Set up the paths for designer, backend, frontend, and architect workspaces by setting the following environment variable:
   
   ```sh
   export AUTOGPT_WORKSPACE=workspace/
   ```

   This variable guide the agents on where to generate the code within your project structure.

1. **API Key Configuration**: Additionally, you need to set up the Gemini API key by setting the following environment variable:

   ```sh
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>
   ```

   To obtain your API key, navigate to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and generate it there. This key allows autogpt to communicate with Gemini API.

1. **DesignerGPT Setup (Optional)**: To enable DesignerGPT, you will need to set up the following environment variable:
   
     ```sh
     export GETIMG_API_KEY=<your_getimg_api_key>
     ```

     Generate an API key from your [GetImg Dashboard](https://dashboard.getimg.ai/api-keys).

1. **MailerGPT Setup (Optional)**: To enable MailerGPT, in addition to these environment variables, you will need to set up the environment:
   
     ```sh
     export NYLAS_SYSTEM_TOKEN=<Your_Nylas_System_Token>
     export NYLAS_CLIENT_ID=<Your_Nylas_Client_ID>
     export NYLAS_CLIENT_SECRET=<Your_Nylas_Client_Secret>
     ```

     Follow [this tutorial](NYLAS.md) for a guide on how to obtain these values.

### Running Agents

Execute agents to perform tasks using the `run` command:

```bash
autogpt run <agent-name>
```

---

## ü§ñ Available Agents

At the current release, Autogpt consists of 6 built-in specialized autonomous AI agents ready to assist you in bringing your ideas to life!

### 1. üé© ManagerGPT

<img src="https://github.com/kevin-rs/kevin/assets/62179149/fc7fb72b-6f45-4c35-99ff-5c0f8e7d54cf" align="left" alt="manager" width="64" />

ManagerGPT serves as the orchestrator of your project, directing the other agents to execute tasks based on your input. When you provide a project prompt, ManagerGPT divides it into tasks for BackendGPT, FrontendGPT, DesignerGPT, and ArchitectGPT.

#### How ManagerGPT Works?

Let's say you want to develop a full-stack app that fetches today's weather in Python using FastAPI. ManagerGPT simplifies this process by breaking it down into specific tasks for each specialized agent:

- **ArchitectGPT**: ManagerGPT instructs ArchitectGPT to design the application's structure, encompassing both backend and frontend components, utilizing Python and FastAPI:

```sh
[*] "ManagerGPT": Executing task: "Develop a full stack app that fetches today's weather in python using FastAPI."
```

ManagerGPT articulates the project goal and communicates it to the ArchitectGPT through Gemini API, which then generates specific steps for architecting the application:

```sh
[*] "ArchitectGPT": Executing tasks: Tasks { description: "- Design the user interface for the weather app, including input fields for location and a display area for weather details.\n- Implement a function to fetch current weather data from a weather API in Python.\n- Create a FastAPI endpoint that calls the weather fetching function and returns the weather data in JSON format.\n- Integrate the FastAPI endpoint with the front end to display the fetched weather data on the user interface.\n- Handle error scenarios and provide appropriate user feedback.", scope: None, urls: None, frontend_code: None, backend_code: None, api_schema: None }
```

- **DesignerGPT**: ManagerGPT guides DesignerGPT in crafting a user-friendly interface tailored for presenting the weather forecast. 

```sh
[*] "DesignerGPT": Executing tasks: Tasks { description: "- Utilize FastAPI in Python to develop a user interface for the weather app, integrating a location input field and display section for weather data.\n- Step 1: Define the layout and structure of the user interface, ensuring it's user-friendly and visually appealing.\n- Step 2: Implement the location search functionality, enabling users to input their desired location and retrieve relevant weather information.", scope: None, urls: None, frontend_code: None, backend_code: None, api_schema: None }
```

- **BackendGPT**: ManagerGPT assigns BackendGPT to implement the backend logic using FastAPI, responsible for fetching weather data from external sources.

```sh
[*] "BackendGPT": Executing tasks: Tasks { description: "- Using FastAPI in Python, create a backend for a weather application featuring a user interface with a location input field and weather data display section.\n- Step 1: Design and develop the user interface, ensuring it's user-friendly and visually appealing.\n- Step 2: Implement the location search functionality, enabling users to input their desired location and retrieve relevant weather information.", scope: None, urls: None, frontend_code: None, backend_code: None, api_schema: None }
```

- **FrontendGPT**: ManagerGPT directs FrontendGPT to develop the frontend interface, enabling users to interact with and visualize the weather data.

```sh
[*] "FrontendGPT": Executing tasks: Tasks { description: "- Using FastAPI in Python, create a user interface for a weather application.\n- Step 1: Create a user-friendly layout for displaying weather information.\n- Step 2: Implement FastAPI endpoints to fetch and display weather data.", scope: None, urls: None, frontend_code: None, backend_code: None, api_schema: None }
```

Finally, ManagerGPT aggregates the outcomes from all GPTs, consolidating the generated tasks into a coherent project plan. Here's the summary of the completed tasks:

```sh
[*] "ManagerGPT": Completed Tasks: Tasks { description: "- Utilizing FastAPI and Python, develop a user-friendly UI for displaying weather data.\n- Step 1: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and develop web pages that showcase weather data effectively.\n- Step 2: Define routes in FastAPI for weather data retrieval and display, ensuring seamless integration between frontend and backend.", scope: None, urls: None, frontend_code: Some("from fastapi import FastAPI, Request\nfrom fastapi.responses import JSONResponse\nimport requests\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.get(\"/weather/{city_name}\")\nasync def get_weather(city_name: str, request: Request):\n    url = f\"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city_name}&appid=YOUR_API_KEY\"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        data = response.json()\n        return JSONResponse(content={\n            \"city_name\": data[\"name\"],\n            \"temperature\": data[\"main\"][\"temp\"] - 273.15,\n            \"humidity\": data[\"main\"][\"humidity\"],\n            \"wind_speed\": data[\"wind\"][\"speed\"]\n        })\n    else:\n        return JSONResponse(content={\"error\": \"Could not fetch weather data\"}, status_code=response.status_code)"), backend_code:  Some("from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Form\nfrom fastapi.templating import Jinja2Templates\nfrom fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse\nimport requests\n\napp = FastAPI()\ntemplates = Jinja2Templates(directory=\"templates\")\n\n@app.get(\"/\", response_class=HTMLResponse)\nasync def index(request: Request):\n    return templates.TemplateResponse(\"index.html\", {\"request\": request})\n\n@app.post(\"/weather\", response_class=HTMLResponse)\nasync def weather(request: Request, city: str = Form(...)):\n    url = f\"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid=YOUR_API_KEY\"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    data = response.json()\n    return templates.TemplateResponse(\"weather.html\", {\"request\": request, \"data\": data})"), api_schema: None }
```
